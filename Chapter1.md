The Onion is Lost:

There was an Onion. 
He had no name because he was an onion and ordinarily onions do not have names.
The onion lived with its onion family.
But one day the onion woke up in a strange land.
He was lost.
And alone.
The onion was very sad because he was pretty sure he had never been lost before and he was uncomfortable with new experiences.
The onion began to feel very existential.
"What is the meaning of life for an onion?" he thought.
Now the onion was feeling emotionally lost as well.
Poor onion.
