A loud, bestial bellow resounded from the shadowy forest. 
Then silence. 
Our little protagonist was so frightened that it couldn't move.
Stuck in the clearing, it shook in fear as a new sound was heard - heavy footsteps - coming closer and closer.
Rooted to the spot, the Onion stared in horror as the underbrush started shaking and heavy breathing became noticeable.
The dense forest made way for the scraped up, ragged, terrible creature - Dad???
"Onion! I've finally found you" said Dad.
The end.
