The Onion is Not Found:

As much as the onion wished for its family to find it, it was no use.
The onion was not found.
The onion began to cry from loneliness.
What if it never found its family again?
The little onion missed its onion siblings dearly.
It almost wished that they were lost too, so that it wouldn't have to be alone, but that felt too cruel.
The poor onion felt too scared to venture out of the forest to search for its family.
It hoped that they would just come back to him, but after hours of waiting and crying, it felt hopeless.
