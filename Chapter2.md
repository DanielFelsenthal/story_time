As much as the onion wished for his family to find him, it was no use.
The onion was not found.
The onion began to cry from loneliness.
What if he never found his family again?
The little onion missed his brother and sister onion dearly.
He almost wished that they were lost too, so that he wouldn't have to be alone, but that felt too cruel.
The poor onion felt too scared to venture out into the forest to search for his family.
He hoped that they would just come back to him, but after hours of waiting and crying, he felt hopeless.
